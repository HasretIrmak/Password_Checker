# Password_Checker

## Overview
The **Password Checker** is a Python application designed to evaluate the security of a password. It performs several checks, including password length, character composition, common password usage, and assigns a security score with recommendations.

## Features
- **Length Validation**: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Character Type Validation**: Checks for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Common Password Detection**: Identifies passwords that are commonly used and considered insecure.
- **Password Scoring**: Assigns a security level (Weak, Medium, Strong) based on the passwordâ€™s characteristics.

## How It Works
1. **Password Input**: The user inputs a password.
2. **Validation Checks**: The application runs several checks to validate the password:
   - Length Check
   - Character Type Check
   - Common Password Check
3. **Security Scoring**: The password is scored based on its length, diversity of character types, and uniqueness.
4. **Feedback**: The application provides feedback and a security level for the password.
